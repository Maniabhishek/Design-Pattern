### Decorator Pattern
- Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
- In decorator pattern we have a base class , and in that base class if we want to add on some more feature to it then we can do so by wrapping the object by a decorator

- in center we have a base class with some feature , then we wrapped it with another object then it has feature1 + base feature
- now outer layer is also an object , so we can further decorate it or wrap it with object

### Real world usage
- let's say we have pizza with base class as Simple Pizza , now on top of it we can decorate it with some toppings mushroom , jalpeno, extra cheese, and so on
- similarly for cars , we have a base car ready, now we want music system on top of it , then power steering and so on

### Why do we need decorator patterns
- big issue to use decorator pattern is class explosion
> -  let's say we make base class called vehicle , then we made another class with AC + Base Vehicle , Power Steering + Base Class
> -  we end up making a tons of classes
- in such situation we have to make hell lot of classes,  so in order to avoid it we use decorator pattern, where we just prepare the base class and then just toppings are added
- most asked interview question on these are:  make coffee machine or pizza class

#### Example
- let's take Base Class Pizza and we have two classes Margarita and VegDelight class that extends base Pizza with a cost method
- now we will make a decorator class which has two child class Mushroom , ExtraCheese with cost method
- now the decorator will be 'has a' , as TopingDecorator has base Pizza and it will also be 'is a' as it will also be an object as pizza
- now once we created a decorator create as many toppings you want by extending Decorator class
