### What is Abstract Factory Pattern?
- Abstract Factory provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### In simple words:
- 👉 Factory creates one object
- 👉 Abstract Factory creates a family of objects that are meant to work together

### One-Line Intuition
- “Factory of factories.”
