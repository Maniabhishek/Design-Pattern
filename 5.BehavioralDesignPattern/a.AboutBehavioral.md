- Behavioral Patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. Behavioral patterns describe not just patterns of objects or classes but also the patterns of communication between them. These patterns characterize complex control flow thatâ€™s difficult to follow at run-time.
- There are three recurring themes in these patterns:
  - Behavioral class patterns use inheritance to distribute behavior between classes.
  - Behavioral object patterns use object composition rather than inheritance.
  - Behavioral object patterns are concerned with encapsulating behavior in an object and delegating requests to it.
