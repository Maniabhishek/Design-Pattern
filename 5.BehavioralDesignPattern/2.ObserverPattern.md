### Observer Pattern
- Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re observing.

#### Problem 
- Imagine that you have two types of objects: a Customer and a Store . The customer is very interested in a particular brand of product (say, it’s a new model of the iPhone) which should become available in the store very soon.
