### Liskov Substitution Principle
- When extending a class, remember that you should be able to pass objects of the subclass in place of objects of the parent class without breaking the client code.
- This means that the subclass should remain compatible with the behavior of the superclass. When overriding a method, extend the base behavior rather than replacing it with something else entirely.
- The substitution principle is a set of checks that help predict whether a subclass remains compatible with the code that was able to work with objects of the superclass. This concept is critical when developing libraries and frameworks because your classes are going to be used by other people whose code you can’t directly access and change.
- Unlike other design principles which are wide open for interpretation, the substitution principle has a set of formal requirements for subclasses, and specifically for their methods. Let’s go over this checklist in detail.

- Parameter types in a method of a subclass should match or be more abstract than parameter types in the method of the superclass. Sounds confusing? Let’s have an example.
- if class B is subtype of class A, then we should be able to replace object of A and B without breaking the behaviour of the program
- Subclass should extend the capability of parent class not narrow it down
