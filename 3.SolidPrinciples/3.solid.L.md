- When extending a class, remember that you should be able to pass objects of the subclass in place of objects of the parent class without breaking the client code.
- This means that the subclass should remain compatible with the behavior of the superclass. When overriding a method, extend the base behavior rather than replacing it with something else entirely.
- The substitution principle is a set of checks that help predict whether a subclass remains compatible with the code that was able to work with objects of the superclass. This concept is critical when developing libraries and frameworks because your classes are going to be used by other people whose code you canâ€™t directly access and change.
