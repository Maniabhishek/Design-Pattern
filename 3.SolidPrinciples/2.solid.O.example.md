- let's see open/ closed principle
- it says open for extension but closed for Modification
- let's understand with the previous example
```
class InvoiceDao2 {
    private inovice: InvoiceRe;
  
    constructor(invoice: InvoiceRe){
      this.inovice = invoice;
    } 
  
    public saveToDb(){
      //save into db
    }
  }
```
- now let's assume that this class is tested and live 
- now tomorrow another requirement comes and we want to save this data in to file as well then 
- we added another method to the above class
```
class InvoiceDao2Re {
  private inovice: InvoiceRe;

  constructor(invoice: InvoiceRe){
    this.inovice = invoice;
  } 

  public saveToDb(){
    //save into db
  }

  public saveToFile(){
    //save to file
  }
}
```
- does our above solution follows the open/ closed principles
- no it doesn't , so how can we improve it  
```
interface IInvoiceDao{
  save(inovice: InvoiceRe):void;
}

class DatabaseInvoiceDao implements IInvoiceDao{
  public save(inovice: InvoiceRe): void {
    //save to db
  }
}

class FileInvoiceDao implements IInvoiceDao{
  public save(inovice: InvoiceRe): void {
    
  }
}
```
- so above code follows the open/closed principle 
- so when tomorrow something comes to save to another db for example mongodb 
- then we wont make changes to these two class but we will make another class that will implement save in order to save data to mognodb

### Example 2
- You have an e-commerce application with an Order class that calculates shipping costs and all shipping methods are hard- coded inside the class. If you need to add a new shipping method, you have to change the code of the Order class and risk breaking it.

- Now when you need to implement a new shipping method, you can derive a new class from the Shipping interface without touching any of the Order classâ€™ code. The client code of the
Order class will link orders with a shipping object of the new class whenever the user selects this shipping methods in the UI.
