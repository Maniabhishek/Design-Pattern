### D -  Dependency Inversion Principle

* Class should depend on interfaces rather than concrete classes 

 * Suppose we have a class of MacBook that take KeyBoard and Mouse in constructor to initialize 
 * Suppose Keyboard interface has class that implements it is WiredKeyboard and BluetoothKeyBoard
 * similarly for Mouse Interface has class that implements it is WiredMouse and BluetoothMouse

```
interface Keyboard{

}

interface Mouse{

}

class WiredKeyboard implements Keyboard{

}

class WiredMouse implements Mouse{

}

class MacBook{
  private keyboard: WiredKeyboard;
  private mouse: WiredMouse;

  constructor(keyboard: WiredKeyboard, mouse: WiredMouse){
    this.keyboard = keyboard;
    this.mouse = mouse;
  }

}
```

 * above class doesn't follow the depedency inversion principle
 * it depend on concrete class which means we cannot pass bluetooth keyboard and mouse 
 * so class should not depend on concrete class but it should depend upon interface 
 * so that it can be changed accordingly , whatever we passes
 */
```
 class MacBook2{
  private keyboard: Keyboard;
  private mouse: Mouse;

  constructor(keyboard: Keyboard, mouse: Mouse){
    this.keyboard = keyboard;
    this.mouse = mouse;
  }

}
```

### Another example
- In this example, the high-level budget reporting class uses a low-level database class for reading and persisting its data. This means that any change in the low-level class, such as when a new version of the database server gets released, may affect the high-level class, which isnâ€™t supposed to care about the data storage details.

- As a result, the direction of the original dependency has been inverted: low-level classes are now dependent on high-level abstractions.
