- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- The main idea of this principle is to keep existing code from breaking when you implement new features.
- A class is open if you can extend it, produce a subclass and do whatever you want with it add new methods or fields, override base behavior, etc. Some programming languages let you restrict further extension of a class with special keywords, such as final . After this, the class is no longer open. At the same time, the class is closed (you can also say complete) if it’s 100% ready to be used by other classes its interface is clearly defined and won’t be changed in the future.
- If a class is already developed, tested, reviewed, and included in some framework or otherwise used in an app, trying to mess with its code is risky. Instead of changing the code of the class directly, you can create a subclass and override parts of the original class that you want to behave differently. You’ll achieve your goal but also won’t break any existing clients of the original class.
