### I - interface segmented Principle

- interfaces should be such , that one should not implement unnecessary functions they do not need 
```
interface RestaurantEmployee{
  washDishes(): void;
  serveFood(): void;
  cookFood(): void;
}

class Waiter implements RestaurantEmployee{
  washDishes(): void {
    //doesn't wash dishes
  }
  serveFood(): void {
    //serve food
  }

  cookFood(): void {
    // doesn't cook food
  }
}
```
- now in above class we have some unnecessary function which we dont even need it hence we should create interface in such a way that , only required funciton are implemented so create small interface for each class

#### let's see another example

- Dropbox doesn't have all the feature in the interface
- While you can still implement these methods and put some stubs there, it wouldnâ€™t be a pretty solution.
- the better approach is break down the interface
